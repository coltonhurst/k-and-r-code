# k-and-r-code

Code and files from going through K&amp;R

Repo Status: temporarily retired (due to time restraints)

Compilation note: all code was compiled & tested with `gcc` and `-std=c89` flag.

### File Organization

Hopefully everything is fairly self explanatory. If not, feel free to ask.

If you see a file named like this: `1-6.c`, that means it's from chapter 1, and section 6. At the top of every file is the page number that the code is either from, or the exercise question is asked.

If you see a file named like this: `1-7-v2.c`, that means it's the second code snippet from chapter 1, section 7. Again, if you read the pages in the book around where the code is based on, it should make sense.
